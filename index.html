<h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Wenchao Cao is completing her Ph.D. at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven with an expected degree date of May 2019. Her research is dedicated to the development of tomographic image/data processing algorithms. Specific topics investigated by Wenchao have included novel beam hardening correction algorithms for CBCT, a novel X-ray spectral estimation scheme that does not require scattering reduction, and imaging performance evaluation and quantitative validation.</p>
    <p>Her passion is to advance tomographic image processing by combining machine learning techniques and the mathematical modeling of imaging physics.</p>
